An educational web-based rendering framework used for my projects.

So far the framework only supports WebGL. I might extend it to support WebGPU in the future. 

In addition I plan to implement different rendering framework architectures that might coexist or be replaced. 
Please be aware that the code is unstable and might break even with minor releases.
